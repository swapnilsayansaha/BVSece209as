Total - this refers to the amount of time spent on spent executing the garbled circuits,
        (setup , OT (oblivious transfer) extension, garbling and executing (online)),
        although real number here actually seems diverge from the definition

Init - Setting up for some event, I'm not really sure what

CircuitGen - generating the circuit for Yao's Garbled Circuits

Network - Time to establish a network connection

BaseOTs - time to precompute for something called Naor-Pinkas base Oblivious Transfer

Setup - Time for Setting up the shares

OTExtension - I'm not sure what the OT extension is

Garbling - Time to perform Yao's Garbled Circuits

Online - Time to evaluate the circuit
