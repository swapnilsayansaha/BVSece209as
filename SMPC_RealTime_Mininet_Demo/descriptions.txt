custom_topo.py -
  just a mininet topology class for two nodes, since this is a two party
  smpc

aby_simulator.py -
  Simulator file for conducting the ABY algorithm over different inputs
  for two parties.
  In this case, we are using the millionaire_prob_test, which
  uses two different input values and determines which is more without
  revealing the inputs to either party (i.e. the millionaire problem)
  This uses the example executable created from encryptogroup's ABY
  implementation, available at github.com/encryptogroup/ABY

millionaire_prob.cpp -
  This is just an instrumented file from the encryptogroup's github
   with certain time calculations for measuring latency.
